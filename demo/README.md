## SDK demos

* `closest-device` - connects to the closest device and prints the device object (the timeout is set by default at 3 seconds).  
* `dfu-node` - runs a direct firmware update. (The firmware zip files are signed, custom built firmwares won't work.)  
* `disconnect` - test for the connection events.  
* `features` - uses the main features of the Wand.  
* `nodejs` - connects to the wand and prints orientation quaternions and button events.
